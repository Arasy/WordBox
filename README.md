# WordBox
Word game made using pygame. In bahasa Indonesia.

I create this several years ago while learning pygame from some blog. I know it is still very simple, but it is playable. I plan to expand it to proper game later (but who knows when xD).

## How to Use 
- install pygame $ pip install pygame
- execute the main program $ python main.py

## How to Play
- Play window will show 5x5 grid of alphabet
- Touch and drag the alphabet until it show a word (in Bahasa Indonesia of course)
- Scores is based on the lenght of the words found
- Close the game with alt-f4

## Next Plan
- Give proper credit to image and sound provider (I forgot actually), or change it
- Give exit button and reset button
- Create level based on difficulty
- Create a page for the definition of the word and link it
- Create multiple game mode (found all, blocked, rolling, etc)
- Give some animation 
- Port it to Unity so it can be built to an apk
- Create a blog post to explain how to make it
